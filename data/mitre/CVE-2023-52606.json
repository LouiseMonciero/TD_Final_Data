    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\npowerpc/lib: Validate size for vector operations\n\nSome of the fp/vmx code in sstep.c assume a certain maximum size for the\ninstructions being emulated. The size of those operations however is\ndetermined separately in analyse_instr().\n\nAdd a check to validate the assumption on the maximum size of the\noperations, so as to prevent any unintended kernel stack corruption.",
